# Week 2
The objective of this week's project was to understand how detectron1 works and how to implement it by inference an image, comparing pretrained  faster rncc and mask rcnn models, then applying a fine tuning, all of this using KITTI  MOTS dataset. 
## Here are some instructions to run the scripts:
### Install the following dependencies:
* Detectron2
* Matpotlib
* Pytorch
* Wandb
* Numpy

### Scripts:
* V.py           : Model inference
* V.py           : Pretrained evaluation  using coco metrics
* c.py           : speed test
* co.py          : C
### Dataset:
* KITTI MOTS
