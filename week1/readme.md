# Week 1
The objective of this week's project was to understand how PyTorch works and how to implement it by comparing the model created during the M3 course in Keras, but this time in PyTorch. This allowed us to better understand these differences.The objective of this week's project was to understand how PyTorch works and how to implement it by comparing the model created during the M3 course in Keras, but this time in PyTorch.
