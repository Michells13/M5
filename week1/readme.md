# Week 1
The objective of this week's project was to understand how PyTorch works and how to implement it by comparing the model created during the M3 course in Keras, but this time in PyTorch. 
## Here are some instructions to run the scripts:
### Install the following dependencies:
* Keras
* Matpotlib
* Pytorch
* Wandb
* Numpy
* Sklearn
### Scripts:
* VGG_SP_NOFC/train_net_sep_conv_keras.py     : Train the M3 model using keras (WnB implemented)
* VGG_SP_NOFC/train_net_sep_conv_pytorch.py   : Train the M3 model usinf pytorch (WnB implemented)
* confusionMatrixKeras.py                     : Creates the confusion matrix  of the keras model(WnB implemented)
* confusionMatrixPytorch.py                   : Creates the confusion matrix  of the pytorch model(WnB implemented)

### Dataset:
* MIT_split
